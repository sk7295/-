are-we-there-yet
----------------

Track complex hiearchies of asynchronous task completion statuses.  This is
intended to give you a way of recording and reporting the progress of the big
recursive fan-out and gather type workflows that are so common in async.

What you do with this completion data is up to you, but the most common use case is to
feed it to one of the many progress bar modules.

Most progress bar modules include a rudamentary version of this, but my
needs were more complex.

Usage
=====

```javascript
var TrackerGroup = require("are-we-there-yet").TrackerGroup

var top = new TrackerGroup("program")

var single = top.newItem("one thing", 10
