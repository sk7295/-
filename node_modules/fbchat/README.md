# Node FB Message Archive Parser

Quickly parse massive FB archives into a much more usable JSON format.

## Background

Facebook provides all your information through an archive downloadable [here](https://www.facebook.com/dyi). However, the messages file they provide is an extremely large and cumbersome HTML file (in my case, it was > 100MB). In order to make this information usable, this command will allow you to parse all the information into usable JSON. This was inspired by an [existing project](https://github.com/ownaginatious/fbchat-archive-parser) in Python.


## Use
Install the command with: 
```javascript
    npm install -g fbchat
```

Run `fbchat messages.htm` in the directory of that file to create a parsed JSON version of it. The created file will be formatted as follows: 

```json
{
    "threads": [
        {
            "participants": ["participant_0", "...", "participant_n"],
            "messages": [
                {
                    "date": "date",
                    "sender": "sender name",
                    "message": "message text"
                },
                "..."
            ]
        },
        "..."
    ]
}
```
