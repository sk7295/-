ws is a simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client
and server implementation.

Passes the quite extensive Autobahn test suite: [server][server-report],
[client][client-report].

**Note**: This module does not work in the browser. The client in the docs is a
reference to a back end with the role of a client in the WebSocket
communication. Browser clients must use the native
[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) object.
