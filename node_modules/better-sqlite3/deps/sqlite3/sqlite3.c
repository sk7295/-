/******************************************************************************
** This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite
** version 3.46.0.  By combining all the individual C code files into this
** single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a single translation
** unit.  This allows many compilers to do optimizations that would not be
** possible if the files were compiled separately.  Performance improvements
** of 5% or more are commonly seen when SQLite is compiled as a single
** translation unit.
**
** This file is all you need to compile SQLite.  To use SQLite in other
** programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines
** the programming interface to the SQLite library.  (If you do not have
** the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy embedded within
** the text of this file.  Search for "Begin file sqlite3.h" to find the start
** of the embedded sqlite3.h header file.) Additional code files may be needed
** if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of programming
** language. The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell is also in a
** separate file. This file contains only code for the core SQLite library.
**
** The content in this amalgamation comes from Fossil check-in
** 96c92aba00c8375bc32fafcdf12429c58bd8.

**

** coverage:
**
**    NO_TEST                     - The branches on this line are not
**                                  measured by branch coverage.  This is
**                                  used on lines of code that actually
**                                  implement parts of coverage testing.
**
**    OPTIMIZATION-IF-TRUE        - This branch is allowed to always be false
**                                  and the correct answer is still obtained,
**                                  though perhaps more slowly.
**
**    OPTIMIZATION-IF-FALSE       - This branch is allowed to always be true
**                                  and the correct answer is still obtained,
**                                  though perhaps more slowly.
**
**    PREVENTS-HARMLESS-OVERREAD  - This branch prevents a buffer overread
**                                  that would be harmless and undetectable
**                                  if it did occur.

** These #defines should enable >2GB file support on POSIX if the

** large file support, or if the OS is windows, these should be no-ops.
**
** Ticket #2739:  The _LARGEFILE_SOURCE macro must appear before any
** system #includes.  Hence, this block of code must be the very first
** code in all source files.
**
** Large file support can be disabled using the -DSQLITE_DISABLE_LFS switch
** on the compiler command line.  This is necessary if you are compiling
** on a recent machine (ex: Red Hat 7.2) but you want your code to work
** on an older machine (ex: Red Hat 6.0).  If you compile on Red Hat 7.2
** without this option, LFS is enable.  But LFS does not exist in the kernel
** in Red Hat 6.0, so the code won't work.  Hence, for maximum binary
** portability you should omit LFS.
**
** The previous paragraph was written in 2005.  (This paragraph is written
** on 2008-11-28.) These days, all Linux kernels support large files, so
** you should probably leave LFS enabled.  But some embedded platforms might
** lack LFS in which case the SQLITE_DISABLE_LFS macro might still be useful.
**
** Similar is true for Mac OS X.  LFS is only supported on Mac OS X 9 and later.
